    <h1>Understanding IP Addresses</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>What is an IP Address?</h2>
    <p>An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a series of numbers that identifies any device on a network. Computers use IP addresses to communicate with each other both over the internet as well as on other networks.</p>

    <h2>Why is an IP Address Important?</h2>
    <p>IP addresses are as important as a person's unique ID card. They help ensure secure connections and enable users to explore the digital world confidently and creatively.</p>

    <h2>What Devices Have IP Addresses?</h2>
    <p>Every network-connected device has an IP address: laptops, desktops, IP phones, servers, websites—even toys connected to the internet.</p>

    <h2>The 4 Types of IP Addresses</h2>
    <p>There are four types: <strong>Public</strong>, <strong>Private</strong>, <strong>Static</strong>, and <strong>Dynamic</strong> IP addresses.</p>

    <h2>Example of an IP Address</h2>
    <p>A typical IP address: <strong>168.212.226.204</strong> (decimal form of a 32-bit binary number).</p>

    <h2>Who Generates IP Addresses?</h2>
    <p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) manages IP space and assigns them via regional Internet registries to ISPs and users.</p>

    <h2>What is IPv4 and IPv6?</h2>
    <p>IPv4 supports ~4.3 billion addresses. IPv6 is newer, supports vastly more addresses, and offers advanced networking features.</p>

    <h2>Can We Change an IP Address?</h2>
    <p>Your ISP assigns your public IP. You can sometimes change it by restarting your router or switching networks.</p>

    <h2>Can Two Devices Have the Same IP?</h2>
    <p>On the same network—no. On separate networks using private IPs—yes. Public IPs must always be unique.</p>

    <h2>Is IPv6 Faster Than IPv4?</h2>
    <p>Generally similar, though in some cases, IPv6 might perform slightly better due to modern infrastructure.</p>

    <h2>Who Uses IPv6?</h2>
    <p>Major providers like Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile use IPv6 for most of their network traffic.</p>

    <h2>What Can a Hacker Do With Your IP?</h2>
    <p>They might spam or try to impersonate you. You can often resolve issues by simply changing your IP.</p>

    <h2>What Information Can Be Obtained From an IP?</h2>
    <p>It can reveal your ISP, city, region, and sometimes more—though not precise personal info without legal access.</p>

    <h2>Does an IP Address Show History?</h2>
    <p>Not directly, but your IP can be linked to browsing history by your ISP or services you use online.</p>
