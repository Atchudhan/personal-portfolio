      <h2>What is IoT Technology?</h2>
      <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What is IoT in simple words?</h2>
      <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a system of interrelated, internet-connected objects that can collect and transfer data over a wireless network without human intervention.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What is IoT with example?</h2>
      <p>IoT includes devices like smartwatches, smart refrigerators, or even connected animals or people, which transfer data over a network without requiring human interaction.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What is the use of IoT?</h2>
      <p>IoT can drive efficiencies and unlock new possibilities. For example, companies use IoT in fleet management to direct trucks in real-time, improving efficiency and safety.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What is the Internet of Things?</h2>
      <p>The IoT is the concept of connecting any device with an on/off switch to the internet. It includes a network of connected objects and people, collecting and sharing data about how they're used and their surroundings.</p>
      <p>Examples include smart microwaves, self-driving cars, fitness trackers, and connected footballs that analyze stats via apps.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>Devices with built-in sensors connect to an IoT platform that integrates and analyzes data, sharing valuable insights with relevant applications. This allows businesses to detect patterns, anticipate issues, and make smarter decisions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Track showroom interest via sensors</li>
        <li>Analyze sales trends for popular products</li>
        <li>Align inventory to real-time demand</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Scenario #1: IoT in your home</h2>
      <p>An IoT alarm clock could wake you up earlier if your train is cancelled and weather conditions require a slower drive to work. It could even sync with your coffee machine to have coffee ready when you get up.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Scenario #2: IoT in transport</h2>
      <p>If your car's engine light turns on, IoT sensors can communicate diagnostics to the manufacturer, schedule service, direct you to a nearby garage, and ensure the correct part is available.</p>
